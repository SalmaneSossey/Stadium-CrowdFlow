# Stadium CrowdFlow

A Smart City dashboard that predicts stadium-area congestion (time + zone) and recommends operational actions
(routes, gates, buses, staff) for match days (Morocco 2030-ready).

## MVP
- Congestion risk prediction by zone/time
- Heatmap + timeline visualization
- Action recommendations based on predicted risk
- Simple evaluation (metrics or simulation impact)

## Repo structure
- backend/: API + model serving
- frontend/: dashboard UI (Streamlit or Next.js)
- data/sample/: small sample datasets (committed)
- data/raw/, data/processed/: ignored (not committed)

## Quickstart (placeholder)
Coming next: docker-compose + run commands.
